Aim:

  To study the different types of vulnerabilities that can be used to hack websites or web applications.

Introduction:

  Web applications are often exposed to the internet and can be attacked if not secured properly.

  Hackers find weaknesses in websites, known as vulnerabilities, to steal data or damage systems.
  
  Understanding these vulnerabilities helps in protecting websites from attacks.

Types of Vulnerabilities:

  SQL Injection: Attackers insert harmful SQL code to access or modify database data.
  
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Hackers inject malicious scripts into web pages seen by users.
  
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Makes users perform actions without their knowledge.
  
  Broken Authentication: Weak login systems allow attackers to steal user accounts.
  
  Security Misconfiguration: Improper setup of servers or applications gives attackers entry.
  
  Sensitive Data Exposure: Poor encryption causes leakage of passwords or personal data.
  
  Insecure File Uploads: Hackers upload harmful files to run code on the server.
  
  Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Old software libraries can be easily attacked.
  
  Unvalidated Input: Not checking user input allows attackers to exploit the system.
  
  Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Delays in detecting attacks make systems more vulnerable.

Observation:

  Different website vulnerabilities were studied, and each can cause serious security risks if not fixed.

Result:

  The various types of web application vulnerabilities were successfully studied and understood.
