Introduction:

    A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
    
    It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks such as the internet.
    
    Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both.
    
    Windows provides an inbuilt Windows Defender Firewall to protect the system from unauthorized access.

Features of Firewall in Network Security:

    Traffic Filtering : Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
    
    Packet Inspection : They inspect data packets to determine whether they should be allowed through or blocked.
    
    Access Control : Firewalls enforce access policies by allowing or denying traffic from specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols.
    
    Protection Against Unauthorized Access : They block unauthorized users from accessing private networks connected to the internet.
    
    Application-Level Filtering : Advanced firewalls can filter traffic based on applications, preventing risky software from communicating over the network.
    
    Logging and Alerts : Firewalls log traffic and generate alerts for suspicious activities, aiding in threat detection and response.
    
    VPN Support : Many firewalls support Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), enabling secure remote access.
    
    Intrusion Prevention : Some firewalls include intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to block known attack patterns.
    
    Network Address Translation (NAT) : Firewalls often perform NAT, hiding internal IP addresses from external networks for added security.
    
    Policy Enforcement : They help enforce organizational security policies by controlling how devices communicate.

Setting Firewall Security in Windows:

    Go to Start > Control Panel > Windows Firewall
    
    Choose between Private and Public network profiles
    
    Click “Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall” to manage exceptions
    
    Use Windows Firewall with Advanced Security (WFAS) for detailed rule configuration (protocols, ports, IP ranges)
    
    Enable features like “Stealth Mode” and “Boot-time Filtering” for enhanced protection
    
    Assign network profiles using Network Location Awareness (NLA): Public, Private, or Domain
    
    Always ensure administrative rights before making changes
